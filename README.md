# Flownative Nginx Image

A Docker image providing [Nginx](https://nginx.org) for [Beach](https://www.flownative.com/beach),
[Local Beach](https://www.flownative.com/localbeach) and other purposes. Compared to other
Nginx images, this one provides specific features which come in handy for running a
[Neos CMS](https://www.neos.io) instance or Neos Flow application.

## tl;dr

```bash
$ docker run flownative/nginx
```

## Hosting a Neos website or Flow application

tbd.

## Hosting a static website

Set the environment variable "BEACH_NGINX_MODE" to "Static" and
optionally set the variable "NGINX_STATIC_ROOT" to the path leading to
the root of your static site.

The BEACH_NGINX_MODE variable follows legacy naming and will be renamed
/ replaced by another concept in the future.

## Configuration

### Logging

By default, the access log is written to STDOUT, and the error log is
redirected to STDERR. That way, you can follow logs by watching
container logs with `docker logs` or using a similar mechanism in
Kubernetes or your actual platform.

The log level for error can be defined via the `NGINX_LOG_LEVEL`
environment variable. See the
[Nginx documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/)
for possible values. The default value is `warn`.

## Security aspects

This image is designed to run as a non-root container. Using an
unprivileged user generally improves the security of an image, but may
have a few side effects, especially when you try to debug something by
logging in to the container using `docker exec`.

When you are running this image with Docker or in a Kubernetes context,
you can take advantage of the non-root approach by disallowing privilege
escalation:

```yaml
$ docker run flownative/nginx:latest --security-opt=no-new-privileges
```

Because Nginx runs as a non-root user, it cannot bind to port 80 and
users port 8080 instead. Since you can map that port to any other port
by telling Docker or Kubernetes, this won't be a problem in practice.
However, be aware that you need to specify 8080 as the container port â€“
otherwise you won't get a connection.
